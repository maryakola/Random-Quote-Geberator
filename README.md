# Random-Quote-Generator
The Random Quote Generator is a simple web application that generates a random quote with the click of a button.
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Upon loading the page, a random quote is displayed on the screen along with the author's name. 
Clicking the "Generate Quote" button will generate a new random quote, which replaces the previous one. 
The quotes used in this application are sourced from a third-party API. 
This project provides a fun and easy way to discover new quotes and authors.
